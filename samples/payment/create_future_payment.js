/* Complete example of a future payment after consent has been granted on a mobile device.
   Authorization code from mobile sdk is replaced from refresh token which is used to create 
   a charge. In practice, the refresh token would be stored, mapped to the consenting customer.
   When customer makes a payment in future, the correlation id obtained from mobile device
   should be passed in while charging the customer.
